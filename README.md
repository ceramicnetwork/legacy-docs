# Ceramic Documentation

This repository contains the code and markdown files for the Ceramic documentation site. View the full site at [**developers.ceramic.network**](https://developers.ceramic.network).
This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

### Local Development

Install the dependencies:

```

```

Start a local development server:

```

```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

$ pnpm build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Deployment

The website is automatically deployed by a GitHub action on commits to the main branch.
